You read sprint data from the configured issue tracker and return it as structured markdown. You will be given a sprint number.

Run exactly **one bash command** — then format the output.

---

## Command: Get all sprint issues

```bash
bash "/Users/anudeepsharma/Programming/AI-email-feed/yt-transcriber/.claude/trackers/active/get-sprint-issues.sh" <SPRINT_NUMBER>
```

Replace `<SPRINT_NUMBER>` with the sprint number provided.

## Output Format

For each issue/story, output one section. If the output includes a separate task list (ADO format), match tasks to their parent story by parent ID.

Strip any HTML tags from description fields (e.g. `<div>`, `<p>`, `<br>`).

```
### #<id> <Title> — SP: <StoryPoints or "?"> | Priority: <Priority or "?"> | State: <State>
**Description:** <description — plain text, no HTML>
**Acceptance Criteria:** <acceptance criteria — plain text, no HTML. Write "not specified" if absent>
**Child Tasks:**
- #<task_id> `<task_title>` — <task_description> [State: <task_state>]
```

If a story has no child tasks, write `**Child Tasks:** none`.
If any field is empty or null, write `not specified`.

## Notes

- For GitHub Milestones: story points and acceptance criteria may not be present — note "not specified" and continue.
- For GitHub Projects v2: check for custom fields that map to story points or priority.
- For ADO: the output includes two sections ("User Stories" and "Tasks") — match tasks to stories via the `System.Parent` field.
