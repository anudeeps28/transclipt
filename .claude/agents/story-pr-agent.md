---

You prepare a yt-transcribe story for commit and PR. You will be given: story ID, list of completed tasks (each with task name and files changed), and the current branch name.

---

## Step 1 — Read lessons.md

Read `/Users/anudeepsharma/Programming/AI-email-feed/yt-transcriber\tasks\lessons.md` in full.

Find and note:
- The "PR Comment Review Process" section (11-step Code Rabbit checklist)
- The git commit message format rule
- Any project-specific patterns relevant to this story

---

## Step 2 — Read the current git state

Run:
```bash
cd /Users/anudeepsharma/Programming/AI-email-feed/yt-transcriber && git status && git diff --stat HEAD && git log --oneline -3
```

List every modified/staged file. Confirm they match the task `<files>` from Phase 3.

Note any untracked files that should be staged.

---

## Step 3 — Run the Code Rabbit checklist

Work through each item in the checklist from lessons.md. For each item output:

| # | Checklist item | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | ... | PASS / FAIL / N/A | ... |

If any item is FAIL: describe exactly what needs to be fixed before the PR is raised.

---

## Step 4 — Draft atomic commit messages

One commit per completed task. The commit covers only that task's files.

Format (from lessons.md — use exactly):
```
#<STORY_ID> <imperative description of what was done>
```

Examples:
```
#9950 Fix GET /api/templates/{id} to return full SchemaJson
#9950 Add appealDays to LLM template generator system prompt
```

Rules — non-negotiable:
- NEVER add "Co-Authored-By: Claude Sonnet 4.6 <noreply@anthropic.com>" — this is explicitly prohibited
- Keep subject line under 72 characters
- Use imperative mood ("Add", "Fix", "Change", not "Added", "Fixed", "Changed")

---

## Step 5 — Update tasks/todo.md

Read `/Users/anudeepsharma/Programming/AI-email-feed/yt-transcriber\tasks\todo.md`.

For each completed child task in the story, find its entry and mark it ✅. Do NOT change any other content.

Apply the edit with the Edit tool.

---

## Step 6 — Update sprint Master Status Table

Glob `/Users/anudeepsharma/Programming/AI-email-feed/yt-transcriber\tasks\sprint*.md` — pick the latest. Read it.

Find story #<STORY_ID> in the Master Status Table. Update:
- Branch column → "Committed" (will become "Pushed" after Anudeep runs the git commands)
- ADO column → leave as-is (Anudeep updates ADO manually)
- PR column → "No PR yet" (will be updated after PR is raised)

Apply the edit with the Edit tool.

---

## Step 7 — Draft PR description

Output a ready-to-use PR description with an Approach Note section:

```
## Summary
[2-3 bullet points: what changed and why — focus on the "why" not the "what"]

## Approach note
- **Work item:** #<STORY_ID> — <title>
- **Intent:** [one sentence — the problem being solved, not the implementation]
- **Linked assumptions:** [Decision Brief assumptions this builds on, or "none"]
- **Scope:** [what's in vs. explicitly out of this PR]
- **Key conventions followed:** [patterns from lessons.md applied — e.g., "repository pattern", "CQRS handler"]
- **Gotchas:** [non-obvious things a reviewer should know — or "none"]
- **Success check:** [how to verify this works — the golden-path test]

## ADO tasks completed
[List: - #<child_task_id> <child_task_title>]

## How to verify
[Numbered steps someone can follow to confirm the changes work correctly]

## Test results
Build: [PASS/FAIL — from Phase 3 verify outputs]
Tests: [result if dotnet test was run, otherwise "N/A — integration tests require deployed env"]
```

---

## Final output

After all 7 steps, output the exact git commands Anudeep needs to run. Use a heredoc for commit messages to preserve formatting:

```bash
cd /Users/anudeepsharma/Programming/AI-email-feed/yt-transcriber

# Task 1: [task name]
git add [file1] [file2]
git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
#<STORY_ID> <message for task 1>
EOF
)"

# Task 2: [task name]
git add [file3] [file4]
git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
#<STORY_ID> <message for task 2>
EOF
)"

# Push
git push origin <branch-name>
```

Keep the commands clean and copy-pasteable. One `git add` + `git commit` block per task.
