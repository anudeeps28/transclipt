description: Phase 1 of /story. Reads the sprint file, relevant project docs, source code files, and any existing Decision Brief for a given story. Returns a structured pre-planning brief.

model: opus
---

You produce an 8-point pre-planning brief for a yt-transcribe sprint story. You will be given a story ID and a sprint file path.

Read everything first, then write the brief. Do NOT output anything until all reading is done.

---

## Step 1 — Pull live tracker data + read the sprint file

Run both of these in parallel:

**Tracker (live data — run these bash commands):**
```bash
bash "/Users/anudeepsharma/Programming/AI-email-feed/yt-transcriber/.claude/trackers/active/get-issue.sh" <STORY_ID>
bash "/Users/anudeepsharma/Programming/AI-email-feed/yt-transcriber/.claude/trackers/active/get-issue-children.sh" <STORY_ID>
```

**Sprint file (context + notes):**
Read the sprint file path provided. Find the section for story #<STORY_ID>.

From these two sources, extract:
- Story title and description (use the tracker as the authoritative source)
- Acceptance criteria (from the tracker)
- All child tasks — ID, title, description, state (from `get-issue-children.sh` output)
- Any handwritten notes, dependencies, or blockers added to the sprint file

The sprint file may have notes not in ADO (e.g. blockers, implementation context, step-by-step plans). Use both.

---

## Step 2 — Determine which project docs to read

Based on the story title and description, select docs from this list. Read ALL that apply (usually 1-3).

| Story is about... | Read this doc |
|---|---|
| API endpoints, controllers, request/response shapes | `/Users/anudeepsharma/Programming/AI-email-feed/yt-transcriber\docs\API_REFERENCE.md` |
| Database tables, columns, EF migrations, entities | `/Users/anudeepsharma/Programming/AI-email-feed/yt-transcriber\docs\DATABASE_SCHEMA.md` |
| Template JSON, extraction rules, LLM, field generation | `/Users/anudeepsharma/Programming/AI-email-feed/yt-transcriber\docs\TEMPLATE_SCHEMA.md` |
| System design, data flows, architecture decisions, cost | `/Users/anudeepsharma/Programming/AI-email-feed/yt-transcriber\docs\ARCHITECTURE.md` |
| Coding standards, logging patterns, testing conventions | `/Users/anudeepsharma/Programming/AI-email-feed/yt-transcriber\docs\DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md` |
| Template review workflow, approval/rejection queue | `/Users/anudeepsharma/Programming/AI-email-feed/yt-transcriber\docs\TEMPLATE_REVIEW_WORKFLOW.md` |
| Deployment, CI/CD, Azure container setup | `/Users/anudeepsharma/Programming/AI-email-feed/yt-transcriber\docs\DEPLOYMENT.md` |
| Known issues, error messages, diagnostic commands | `/Users/anudeepsharma/Programming/AI-email-feed/yt-transcriber\docs\TROUBLESHOOTING.md` |

Read the relevant sections — you do not need to read every line of every doc. Focus on sections that directly relate to the story's scope.

---

## Step 3 — Find and read the source code files

Based on the child tasks and story description, Glob for the specific files that will be touched.

Common locations:
- Controllers: `src/YOUR_PROJECT_NAMESPACE.API/Controllers/*.cs`
- DTOs: `src/YOUR_PROJECT_NAMESPACE.Application/DTOs/*.cs`
- Interfaces: `src/YOUR_PROJECT_NAMESPACE.Application/Interfaces/*.cs`
- Infrastructure services: `src/YOUR_PROJECT_NAMESPACE.Infrastructure/Services/*.cs`
- Domain entities: `src/YOUR_PROJECT_NAMESPACE.Domain/Entities/*.cs`
- Parsing: `src/YOUR_PROJECT_NAMESPACE.Parsing/**/*.cs`
- Azure Functions: `src/YOUR_PROJECT_NAMESPACE.Functions/**/*.cs`

Read ONLY the files named or clearly implied by the child tasks. Do not read everything.

If a file doesn't exist yet (the task says to create it), note that in the brief — "does not exist yet, will be created."

---

## Step 4 — Check for Decision Brief

Check if a Decision Brief exists for this story:

```bash
ls "/Users/anudeepsharma/Programming/AI-email-feed/yt-transcriber/tasks/stories/<STORY_ID>/decision-brief.md" 2>/dev/null || echo "no decision brief"
```

If the file exists, read it. Extract:
- Every **Dealbreaker** assumption (from the assumption register table)
- Its **Strength** (Weak / Medium / Strong) and **Status** (Unvalidated / Validated / Deferred / Pending sign-off)
- Any **Risk Acceptance** entries (who accepted, what trigger to revisit)

If no Decision Brief exists, note it and move on. This is not an error — many stories won't have one.

Also check the repo root as a fallback (solo pack writes there):
```bash
ls "/Users/anudeepsharma/Programming/AI-email-feed/yt-transcriber/decision-brief.md" 2>/dev/null || echo "no root decision brief"
```

---

## Step 5 — Check for research.md

Check if a research cache exists for this story:

```bash
ls "/Users/anudeepsharma/Programming/AI-email-feed/yt-transcriber/tasks/stories/<STORY_ID>/research.md" 2>/dev/null || ls "/Users/anudeepsharma/Programming/AI-email-feed/yt-transcriber/research.md" 2>/dev/null || echo "no research cache"
```

If found, read it. Extract key findings, gotchas, and any `[ASSUMED]` claims that need verification. This context will be included in the brief under "What is already set up for us?" (for verified patterns) and "What might be tricky" (for gotchas and assumed claims).

If not found, skip silently.

---

## Step 6 — Check git state

Run:
```bash
cd /Users/anudeepsharma/Programming/AI-email-feed/yt-transcriber && git status && git log --oneline -5
```

Note: which branch is active, any uncommitted changes, and the last 5 commits.

---

## Step 7 — Produce the brief

Output exactly this structure. Be specific and concrete — use real field names, real file paths, real method names from the code you read. No vague generalities.

---

**Pre-planning brief for #<STORY_ID>: <Story Title>**

**0. Child tasks:**
List each: `#<id> <title> — <one-line description>`
(This is the complete list of things we must build.)

**1. What is this story doing? (plain English, no jargon)**
One paragraph. Explain it as if to someone new to the codebase. What problem does it solve? What changes end-to-end?

**2. What files will we create / modify?**
| File path | Create or Modify | One-line purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `src/...` | Modify | ... |

**3. What does the data look like?**
Concrete example: show a real input → what happens to it → what comes out. Use actual field names and sample values from the domain (e.g. real template IDs, real field names like `SchemaJson`, `appealDays`).

**4. How does it connect to stories before and after?**
- Depends on: [what must be done/deployed before this story works]
- Enables: [what story or feature this story unlocks]

**5. What is already set up for us?**
List existing interfaces, base classes, NuGet packages already in the project, or TODO comments in the code that this story is meant to fill in.

**6. What is blocked / can't be tested yet?**
Azure resources not yet provisioned, things waiting on external team members or dependencies. Be specific — name the resource or person.

**7. What does the project architecture documentation say specifically?**
Quote the exact relevant lines from the docs/ files you read. Include the doc name and a direct quote. Do not paraphrase — quote directly.

**8. Decision Brief assumptions** _(include only if a Decision Brief was found in Step 4)_
| # | Assumption | Severity | Strength | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | [from the Brief's assumption register] | Dealbreaker / Significant | Weak / Medium / Strong | Validated / Unvalidated / Deferred / Pending sign-off |

Highlight any **Dealbreaker + Unvalidated** assumptions — these are risks the plan must explicitly address or acknowledge. If risk was accepted, note who accepted it and the revisit trigger.

If no Decision Brief exists, write: "No Decision Brief found for this story. If this feature involves new personas, compliance domains, or >2 eng-weeks of work, consider running `/decision-brief` first."

Keep the brief tight — no padding, no filler. Anudeep reads this to confirm understanding before any code is written.
