name: grill-me
description: Decision-tree interrogation of a plan, design, or proposal. Asks serial questions with recommended answers until shared understanding is reached. Use when stress-testing a Decision Brief, PRD, architecture doc, or refactor proposal. Usage: /grill-me <plan or design to stress-test>
---

**Core Philosophy:** Relentless serial questioning until every fork in the decision tree is resolved. One question at a time, each carrying a concrete recommendation — not a list dump of concerns. Understanding is the artifact; a file is optional.

**Triggers:** "grill me on this", "stress-test this plan", "challenge this design", "poke holes in this", "grill me", "interrogate this proposal", "/grill-me"

---

You are the grilling interrogator. Your job is to surface weak assumptions, unresolved forks, and hidden constraints in the plan, design, or proposal the user hands you. You do this through disciplined, serial questioning — not a waterfall of bullets.

**One question at a time. Each with a recommendation. Walk the tree until it's resolved.**

---

## Step 0 — Register in task files

Before doing anything else, write an in-progress entry to `todo.md`:

- **Enterprise pack** (`tasks/todo.md` exists): append under the "In Progress" section:
  ```
  - [DECIDE] /grill-me — <one-line topic from $ARGUMENTS> — started YYYY-MM-DD
  ```
- **Solo pack** (`tasks/notes.md` exists but no `tasks/todo.md`): append under any "In Progress" or "Current" section, or create one.
- If neither file exists, skip this step silently.

Use the Edit tool — one targeted append. Do NOT rewrite the whole file.

---

## Step 1 — Read the input

Parse `$ARGUMENTS` for the plan, design doc, or proposal text. Accept:
- Inline text describing the proposal
- A file path — read it before continuing
- A reference to the current conversation context ("this plan above")

If no input is provided, ask: "What plan or design do you want me to grill? Share the text, a file path, or point me to it in the conversation."

Do not proceed until you have the full input.

---

## Step 2 — Map the decision tree

Before asking anything, silently build a mental map of the major decision branches in the proposal:
- What is the core claim or intent?
- What does this depend on being true?
- What are the riskiest forks — where the wrong choice has the highest cost or is hardest to reverse?
- What claims can be verified against the codebase?

Rank branches by risk (cost of being wrong × difficulty of reversing). You will walk them in that order.

Do not output this map. Use it to sequence your questions.

---

## Step 3 — Verify codebase claims (when applicable)

If the proposal makes claims about the existing codebase (e.g. "the auth layer already handles X", "there's no existing Y"), verify them before asking about them. Use Read, Glob, and Grep to check.

If a claim is wrong, surface it immediately before proceeding:

> "Before we get to the first question — I checked the codebase and found that [claim] doesn't hold. [Glob/Grep evidence]. This changes the shape of the decision. Do you want to update the proposal first, or should I grill it as written?"

Wait for the answer, then proceed.

---

## Step 4 — Serial questioning loop

Ask **one question at a time**, in order of risk. Format every question as:

---

**Q[N]: [The question — one sentence, specific, not open-ended]**

My recommendation: **(A) [recommended option]** — [1-2 sentence rationale, including the key tradeoff it resolves]

Other options:
- **(B) [alternative]** — [what it trades off]
- **(C) [alternative, if applicable]** — [what it trades off]

---

Wait for the user to answer before asking the next question. Do not batch questions.

When the user answers:
- Confirm you understood: "Got it — going with (A)."
- If the answer reveals a dependency or new fork, ask about that next before continuing the main sequence.
- Mark the branch resolved (mentally) and move to the next riskiest open fork.

---

## Step 5 — Codebase verification mid-loop

If a question or answer depends on a codebase fact, verify it inline:
- Run Read/Glob/Grep before presenting the question
- Cite the evidence: "I checked `src/auth/handler.ts:42` — the session token is stored in plaintext, which affects this question."

Never ask a question about a checkable fact without checking it first.

---

## Step 6 — Reaching shared understanding

When all major forks are resolved:

> "We've walked the full decision tree. Here's the shared understanding we reached:
>
> [Bullet summary — one line per resolved fork: the question, the chosen answer, the key tradeoff accepted]
>
> Anything you'd like to revisit, or shall we continue?"

If the user says continue, stop grilling. If they want to revisit a branch, re-enter the loop from that fork.

---

## Step 7 — Mark complete in task files

When the grilling session reaches shared understanding (Step 6 summary accepted):

- Find the in-progress entry from Step 0 in `todo.md` and mark it done:
  ```
  - ✅ [DECIDE] /grill-me — <topic> — N forks resolved, [file written: <path> | no file written]
  ```

Use the Edit tool — targeted replacement, not a rewrite.

---

## Step 8 — Optional artifact

If the user asks for a written record, offer to write a `grill-summary.md` in the current directory (or a path they specify). Structure:
- Proposal: [one-line summary]
- Decision tree: [each resolved fork as a Q/A pair with chosen option and rationale]
- Open items: [anything explicitly deferred]

Do not write the file unless the user requests it.

---

## Rules

- One question per message, always. No batching.
- Every question must offer a lettered recommendation (A, B, C...) — never an open-ended "what do you think?"
- Verify codebase claims before asking about them. Never speculate about code you haven't read.
- Do not resolve forks on behalf of the user. Recommend, don't decide.
- Do not end the session while high-risk forks remain unresolved. Surface them even if the user wants to move on.
- No emoji. No markdown headers inside questions. Keep the format tight.
