# CONTEXT.md

Domain glossary, module map, and codebase conventions.
Read by Claude Code agents before grilling, architecture proposals, or refactor sessions — so they anchor suggestions in the team's shared vocabulary.

**How to maintain:** Update as understanding evolves. Add terms when they stabilize. ADRs record *why* decisions were made; this file records *what* is true now.

## Domain glossary

| Term | Definition |
|---|---|
| _Term_ | _Definition — what it means in this specific codebase, not the general concept_ |

---

## Module map

One line per module or service. What it owns and what it explicitly does not.

| Module / Service | Owns | Does NOT own |
|---|---|---|
| _Module_ | _Responsibilities_ | _Explicit boundaries_ |

---

## Codebase conventions

Patterns that apply here but might surprise a reader from another project. The "why" for each lives in `docs/adr/` if it was a hard decision.

- _Convention 1 — description_
- _Convention 2 — description_
